# Roadmap 1.x

Motivation
----------

This project was originally started as a complution for me to make a software
that remaping capslock into esc because there's no existing software eq powertoys/karabiner that can run natively on windows 10 arm64 machine
event for the `powertoys` that backed by microsoft who's released Surface Pro X hasn't prioritized it yet
[https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/490](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/490)

It started when I was on OS X, there is [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/),
it was quite easy to transform the most useless key ever (for me atleast) in the most useful one
**CAPSLOCK become ESC when it pressed alone, become CTRL/CMD when in pressed along with other keys**
